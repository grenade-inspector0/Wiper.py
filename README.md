# What is Wiper.py?
- Wiper.py is a secure data erasure tool that is written in Python, which only has support for Linux. 

# How do I use Wiper.py?
1. To use Wiper.py you'll first need [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.
2. Next you'll want to navigate to the folder where Wiper.py was installed to and open a terminal in the same folder.
3. Now, you'll want to run Wiper.py with administrative privileges by running, "sudo python Wiper.py".
4. Finally, just answer a few questions, then you can sit back and relax while your data is securely erased.

# My Recommendations
- I recommend that you do at least 3 passes with a final round of zeroing. Anything more than 3 passes is only necessary in very certain cases, so I would recommend against it, especially considering that the more passes you do, the longer it will take.
